# Politician Speech Classifier

Using Tensorflow LSTM neural network models and text tokenizer to classify political speeches made by U.S and international politicians. Working on classifying international politican speeches by how adversarial each speech is.


Goal: Creating a Neural network that classifies whether a given international speech is adversarial, friendly, or unrelated to the United States. Then use the Bayesian Optimization method of hyperparameter
tuning in order to reach a desired accuracy.
